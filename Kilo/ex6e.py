# Make a word guessing game. The user should be able
# to continue guessing until guessing the word correctly 
# (regardless of uppercase/lowercase). Every time the user
# guesses, you should display how many guesses the user 
# has taken so far. Give special messages after certain
# guesses -- for example, after the third guess, say 
# "Three strikes, you're out! Just kidding, you can keep
# guessing." Note: For extra fun, use the Python termcolor module.

# Make a number guessing game. Give the user feedback with
# each guess: "Too high" or "Too low".
